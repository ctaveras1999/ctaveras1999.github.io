I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department at Rice University. Broadly, I aspire to 
further our understanding of signal processing, machine learning, and
other manifestations of applied math.

Currently, I am an intern at [Adobe Research][adobe] working with [Kalyan Sunkavalli][ks] and 
[Yannick Hold-Geoffroy][yhg] on practical implementations of photometric stereo.

From 2017 to 2022, I was a student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I 
received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering. While at 
CMU, I was fortunate to have worked with [Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan][aswin] on problems in 
photometric stereo and with [Richard M. Stern][rich] on 
a variant of the cocktail party problem. 

I am also a proud alumnus of [DeWitt Clinton High School][dwc] in The Bronx, NYC, whose alumni have 
[profoundly impacted][copw] just about every facet of American culture. Clinton boasts a host of 
notable alumni including [James Baldwin][jb], [Stan Lee][sl], [Ralph Lauren][rl], [Sugar Ray Robinson][srr],
[The Kid Mero][mero], [A Boogie wit da Hoodie][abg], and many, many [more].
