I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department at Rice University ([Rice ECE][rice]). Broadly, I aspire to 
further our understanding of [signal processing][sp], [machine learning][ml], and
other manifestations of applied math.

I am currently an intern at [Adobe Research][adobe] working with [Kalyan Sunkavalli][ks] and 
[Yannick Hold-Geoffroy][yhg] on extracting fine-grain details of materials 
for use in rendering.

From 2017 to 2022 I was a student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I 
received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering ([CMU ECE][ece]). While at 
CMU, I worked with [Prof. Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan][aswin] on problems in 
[photometric stereo][ps] and with [Prof. Richard M. Stern][rich] on 
a variant of [the cocktail party problem][cpp]. 

I am a proud alumnus of [DeWitt Clinton High School][dwc] in The Bronx, whose alumni have 
[profoundly affected][copw] just about every facet of American culture. Clinton boasts 
alumni including [James Baldwin][jb], [Stan Lee][sl], [Ralph Lauren][rl], [Sugar Ray Robinson][srr],
[The Kid Mero][mero], [A Boogie wit da Hoodie][abg], and many, many more.
