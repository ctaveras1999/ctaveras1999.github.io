Hey! I'm Carlos, a second year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering (ECE) Department at Rice University ([Rice][rice]) where I am advised by 
[Santiago Segarra][santi] and [CÃ©sar A. Uribe][cesar] working on topology constrained 
transport over networks. 
My interests span signal processing, topology, optimal transport, optimization, and other manifestations of applied math.

From 2017 to 2022, I was a student at Carnegie Mellon University ([CMU][cmu]) where I 
received B.S. ('21) and M.S. ('22) degrees also in ECE. 
There, I was fortunate to have worked with [Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan][aswin] 
on photometric stereo and with [Richard M. Stern][rich] on a variant of the 
cocktail party problem.

In a previous life, I interned at [Adobe Research][adobe] (Summer 2022) where I worked with with [Kalyan Sunkavalli][ks] and [Yannick Hold-Geoffroy][yhg] on near-light and area-light variants of photometric stereo.
